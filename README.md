The plugin is derived from https://github.com/billsuxx/plugin.video.hbogohu witch is derived from https://kodibg.org/forum/thread-504.html

REQUIRMENTS:
* Kodi 18 (Inputstream Adaptive), on any platform supported by Kodi http://kodi.tv
* Libwidevine >=1.4.8.970 (Your device might include it already or might not, not all devices have the same widevine certification level, witch can impact playback ability and max quality of DRM content, please make sure to read the licence agreement that comes with it, so you know what you´re getting yourself into.)
* playback quality (resolution) of DRM content in Kodi, and if the playback will work at all, depends on Inputstream Adaptive and Libwidevine and widevine certification level on your device, and the service provider requirments and restrictions for the specific content. HDCP support can play a role as well.
